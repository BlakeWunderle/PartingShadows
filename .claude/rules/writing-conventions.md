# Writing Conventions

## Narrative Text

All in-game narrative text (battle pre/post text, choice labels, town dialogue) must follow these rules:

- **No em dashes**: Do not use em dashes (the long dash character). Use periods, commas, semicolons, or restructured sentences instead.
- **Proper punctuation**: Use standard English punctuation throughout.
- **No ellipsis abuse**: Use ellipsis (...) sparingly, only for genuine trailing off in dialogue.

These rules apply to all `pre_battle_text`, `post_battle_text`, and `choices` arrays in battle config files.
