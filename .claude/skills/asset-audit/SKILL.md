# Asset Audit & Management

Manages the split between the Godot project (`PartingShadows/assets/`) and the asset library (`assets_library/`). Verifies no referenced assets are missing, manages music track selection, and maintains `.gdignore` exclusions.

## Architecture

Assets are organized into three tiers:

| Location | Purpose | Size |
|----------|---------|------|
| `PartingShadows/assets/` | Runtime assets (sprites, music, tilesets, audio) | ~2-3 GB |
| `assets_library/` | Source packs + excess music (not in Godot project) | ~20 GB |
| `.gdignore`'d dirs | Downloaded but unused art packs (excluded from import/export) | ~900 MB |

### What lives where

- **Sprite source packs** (`assets_library/sprites/`): Raw CraftPix downloads. Python tools read from here and write processed outputs + SpriteFrames into the Godot project.
- **Excess music** (`assets_library/music/`): Tracks not selected by the music curation system. Managed by `MUSIC_MANIFEST.json`.
- **Active music** (`assets/audio/music/{context}/`): 5 tracks per context, selected by `curate_music.py`.
- **Unused art packs** (`.gdignore`'d): Downloaded tilesets, GUI art, icons, objects with zero runtime references.

## Tools

### Asset Audit (`tools/asset_audit.py`)

```bash
# Full audit: check references + report sizes
python PartingShadows/tools/asset_audit.py

# Place .gdignore files in unused directories
python PartingShadows/tools/asset_audit.py --fix

# Size report only
python PartingShadows/tools/asset_audit.py --sizes
```

The audit checks:
1. All `res://assets/` paths in `.gd`/`.tres`/`.tscn` files exist on disk or in the library
2. No referenced path is inside a `.gdignore`'d directory
3. Reports project size, library size, and excluded size

### Music Curation (`tools/curate_music.py`)

```bash
# Initial curation — select 5 tracks per context, move rest to library
python PartingShadows/tools/curate_music.py

# Change tracks per context
python PartingShadows/tools/curate_music.py --per-context 10

# Sync from existing manifest (restore selections after fresh clone)
python PartingShadows/tools/curate_music.py --sync

# List current track selections and check for missing files
python PartingShadows/tools/curate_music.py --list
```

Music contexts: `battle`, `battle_dark`, `battle_scifi`, `boss`, `cutscene`, `exploration`, `menu`, `town`

The manifest at `assets/audio/music/MUSIC_MANIFEST.json` is tracked in git and is the source of truth for which tracks are active.

## Workflows

### After downloading new asset packs

1. Downloads go to `assets_library/` (configured in `tools/download_craftpix.py`)
2. Run sprite generation tools which read from `assets_library/sprites/` and write to the Godot project
3. Run `python PartingShadows/tools/asset_audit.py` to verify

### Swapping music tracks

1. Edit `assets/audio/music/MUSIC_MANIFEST.json` — replace a track name with one from `assets_library/music/{context}/`
2. Run `python PartingShadows/tools/curate_music.py --sync` to move files accordingly
3. Commit the updated manifest

### Before export

1. Run `python PartingShadows/tools/asset_audit.py` — should pass with 0 warnings
2. Run `python PartingShadows/tools/asset_audit.py --fix` to ensure all `.gdignore` files are placed
3. Build: `"C:/Users/blake/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WinGet/Packages/GodotEngine.GodotEngine_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe/Godot_v4.6.1-stable_win64_console.exe" --path PartingShadows --headless --quit`

### After fresh clone / new machine

1. Download asset packs (or copy `assets_library/` from backup)
2. Run `python PartingShadows/tools/curate_music.py --sync` to restore music selections
3. Run `python PartingShadows/tools/asset_audit.py --fix` to place `.gdignore` files

## .gdignore Managed Directories

These directories contain downloaded asset packs with zero runtime references:

| Directory | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| `assets/art/tilesets/battle/dungeon_free/` | Unused tileset |
| `assets/art/tilesets/battle/dungeon_roguelike/` | Unused tileset |
| `assets/art/tilesets/battle/farm/` | Unused tileset |
| `assets/art/tilesets/battle/flying_islands/` | Unused tileset |
| `assets/art/tilesets/battle/seabed/` | Unused tileset |
| `assets/art/tilesets/battle/tavern/` | Unused tileset |
| `assets/art/tilesets/battle/training_arena/` | Unused tileset |
| `assets/art/tilesets/battle/winter/` | Unused tileset |
| `assets/art/tilesets/buildings/` | Unused tileset |
| `assets/art/gui/` | Downloaded GUI art pack |
| `assets/art/icons/` | Downloaded icon pack |
| `assets/art/objects/` | Downloaded objects pack |
| `assets/art/ui/Sprites/` | Downloaded UI sprites |

To add a new exclusion, add the path to `GDIGNORE_DIRS` in `tools/asset_audit.py` and run `--fix`.
