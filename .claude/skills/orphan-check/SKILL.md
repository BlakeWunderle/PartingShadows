# Orphan Resource & Scene Detection

Detects `.tres` resources and `.tscn` scenes in `EchoesOfChoiceGame/` that have zero external references — meaning no script, resource, or scene file loads or references them.

## Running the Tool

```bash
# Default: show only orphans
"C:/Users/blake/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WinGet/Packages/GodotEngine.GodotEngine_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe/Godot_v4.6.1-stable_win64_console.exe" --path EchoesOfChoiceGame --headless --script res://tools/orphan_check.gd

# Show all files with reference counts
... -- --all

# Filter to one category
... -- abilities
... -- enemies --all
```

## Categories Scanned

| Category | Directory | What to check |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Abilities | `resources/abilities/` | Referenced via `ExtResource` in class/enemy `.tres` |
| Classes | `resources/classes/` | Referenced via `load()` in battle configs, `ExtResource` in upgrade_options |
| Enemies | `resources/enemies/` | Referenced via `load()` in `battle_config_prog_*.gd` |
| Items — Consumable | `resources/items/` (flat) | Referenced by string ID in `Town.gd`, `map_data.gd`, `travel_event.gd` |
| Items — Equipment | `resources/items/equipment/` | Referenced as `"equipment/<name>"` in `Town.gd` shops |
| Scenes | `scenes/` (recursive) | Referenced via `change_scene()`, `preload()`, `load()` in scripts |

## How Detection Works

For each resource/scene file, two strategies are used:

1. **Full path match** — searches all `.gd`, `.tres`, `.tscn` files for the exact `res://` path (catches `ExtResource`, `load()`, `preload()`, `change_scene()`)
2. **Quoted basename match** — searches for the filename stem in double quotes, e.g. `"slash"` for `slash.tres` (catches dynamic loading via `load("res://.../%s.tres" % id)` and string ID references in shop/reward arrays). For equipment items, also checks `"equipment/<stem>"`. Skipped for `.tscn` files since scene refs always use full paths.

The tool excludes `res://tools/` from the search corpus — references only in tool scripts do not count as real usage.

## Cleanup Workflow

1. **Run the tool** to identify orphans
2. **Review each orphan** — confirm it's truly unused (check if it was recently added and not yet wired up)
3. **Delete orphaned files** including any `.import` sidecar files
4. **Build** to verify no breakage: `--path EchoesOfChoiceGame --headless --quit`
5. **Re-run the tool** to confirm 0 orphans
6. **Commit** the deletions

## Edge Cases

- **Newly added resources**: A resource just created but not yet wired into a class/battle config will show as orphaned — don't delete it, wire it up instead
- **Common basenames**: A file like `guard.tres` has stem `"guard"` which may match in unrelated quoted strings, producing a false negative (not flagged when it should be). Full path match catches these correctly
- **Dynamic sprite loading**: `SpriteFrames` `.tres` files are loaded via `sprite_id` strings in `SpriteLoader` — these aren't currently scanned but would be caught by quoted basename match if they lived under `resources/`

## When to Run

- After adding or removing ability/class/enemy/item `.tres` files
- After adding or removing `.tscn` scene files
- During periodic cleanup passes
- Before a major release to trim unused assets
