# Echoes of Choice

A text-based RPG where a mysterious stranger in a tavern sets three warriors on a branching journey. Choose your class, upgrade your abilities, and fight your way through a world where every decision shapes your path. No two playthroughs are the same.

## How to Play

The game runs in the console. Type your choices and press Enter.

- **Character creation**: Name three warriors and pick a class for each.
- **Battle actions**: On your turn, choose to `Attack`, use an `Ability` (costs mana), or view `Stats`.
- **Path choices**: After certain battles, choose which direction to travel. Each path leads to different enemies and encounters.
- **Class upgrades**: After key victories, each warrior finds an item that evolves their class and abilities.
- **Auto-save**: The game saves after every victory. On startup, choose to continue or start fresh.

## Classes

Four base classes, each branching into unique upgrade paths across two tiers -- 32 final classes in total.

| Base Class | Playstyle |
|------------|-----------|
| **Squire** | High health and physical attack. The front-line fighter. |
| **Mage** | High magic attack and mana. Elemental damage and healing. |
| **Entertainer** | High speed with a mix of offensive and support abilities. |
| **Scholar** | Strong magic stats with unique utility abilities. |

Each class upgrade presents a meaningful choice -- there are no wrong answers, just different builds.

### Class Evolution

## Stats

- **Health** -- Your life total. Drops to zero and that character is knocked out for the rest of the battle.
- **Mana** -- Fuels abilities. Starts full each battle and does not regenerate during combat.
- **Physical Attack** -- Determines damage from basic attacks and physical abilities.
- **Physical Defense** -- Reduces incoming physical damage.
- **Magic Attack** -- Determines damage from magical abilities.
- **Magic Defense** -- Reduces incoming magical damage.
- **Speed** -- Controls how often a character gets a turn. Faster characters act more frequently.
- **Crit Chance** -- Likelihood of landing a critical hit. Applies to both basic attacks and abilities.
- **Crit Damage** -- Bonus damage multiplier when a critical hit lands.
- **Dodge Chance** -- Chance to completely avoid a physical attack. Abilities cannot be dodged.

## Combat

- **Turns** -- Speed fills a hidden gauge. When it's full, that character acts. Faster characters can take multiple turns before a slower one gets a single turn.
- **Basic attacks** cost no mana and deal damage based on Physical Attack minus the target's Physical Defense. They can be dodged and can land critical hits.
- **Abilities** cost mana and cannot be dodged. Damage scales with the relevant attack stat minus the target's matching defense. They can still land critical hits. Some abilities target all enemies or all allies.
- **Buffs and debuffs** are temporary stat changes that wear off after a set number of turns.
- **Taunt** forces all enemies to attack the taunting character for one turn, protecting fragile allies.
- **Mana** does not regenerate during battle. Every ability spent is mana you won't have later in the fight.
- **Knockouts** -- When a character's health reaches zero, they are knocked out for the rest of that battle. If the party wins, all knocked-out allies are revived and rejoin at full health. If all three fall, the journey ends.

## Party Tips

- You create three warriors at the start. Consider covering different roles rather than tripling up on one class.
- **Damage dealers** end fights faster but need someone to keep them alive.
- **Healers** are invaluable in long fights, but they can't carry a battle alone.
- **Tanks** with Taunt can draw enemy attacks and shield fragile allies.
- **Support** characters who buff allies or debuff enemies can turn the tide in tough encounters.
- Mana does not regenerate during battle, so balance ability use with basic attacks to avoid running dry.
- Abilities cannot be dodged, making them reliable against evasive enemies.

## The Journey

- The journey begins in a tavern and leads through forests, caves, shores, and stranger places.
- After certain victories, each warrior discovers an item that evolves their class. Choose carefully -- each item leads to a different specialization.
- The road branches. Not every playthrough visits the same locations or faces the same enemies.
- Allies may join your cause before the final confrontation.
- There are multiple routes to the end, and the challenges you face depend on the choices you make.
